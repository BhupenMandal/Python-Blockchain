# Blockchain

## Description
Implemented a linked list containing a node block and a pointer which point to the next block. When new data is added, new hash is created with appropriate timestamp. At the same time, information regarding the previous block is also stored. 
Then, the new block is added to the blockchain. 

Appending data, timestamp and previous block information to a fresh block makes the time and space complexity Big O(n)
